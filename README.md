# Telegram_bot

 > In this project, I built a Telegram Bot that asks random trivia questions based on facts that happened in the passed. It also sends you a random Chuck Norris joke every time you type in the command /joke. The main goal is to make a massive use of external API`s by putting into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming, classes, modules, objects and accessing their attributes.
The project is built using the TDD technique.

## Below here, you can see a screenshot demo of the bot /start command

## The available commands in the telegram bot
- `/start` receive a greetings message.
- `/joke`  receive random Chuck Norris joke.
- `/trivia` receive trivia question.
- `/help`  receive help on commands.
- `about`  receive info about the creator.
